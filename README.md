The impact of synthetic data in the segmentation of surface objects using the WASR‑T network

The project goes through the process of training models for the segmentation of surface objects
using the WASR‑T network. Models were developed and trained on synthetic data, real data, and a
mixed dataset, and the accuracies of individual models were compared.
